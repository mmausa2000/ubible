# WebSocket Multiplayer Fixes - Quick Reference

## What Was Fixed?

### üéØ Root Causes of Quiz Freezes
1. **Out-of-order messages** - Late messages causing UI to show wrong state
2. **Incomplete reconnection** - Missing scores/state after network hiccup
3. **No dead connection detection** - Client unaware connection is dead
4. **No message validation** - Duplicate/stale messages processed

---

## üîß Changes Made

### Server Side (handlers/multiplayer.go)

#### 1. Added Sequence Numbers to All Messages
```go
// Every broadcast now includes:
{
    "type": "next_question",
    "payload": {...},
    "seq": 42,              // ‚Üê NEW: Monotonic sequence
    "timestamp": 1730000000 // ‚Üê NEW: Unix timestamp (ms)
}
```

**Location**: Lines 92-97 (Message struct), 1500-1535 (broadcastToRoom)

#### 2. Enhanced Reconnection State
```go
// Reconnect now sends full state snapshot:
{
    "player_scores": {...},      // ‚Üê All player scores
    "players_answered": {...},   // ‚Üê Who answered current Q
    "time_remaining": 15,        // ‚Üê Seconds left
    "current_seq": 42            // ‚Üê Latest message seq
}
```

**Location**: Lines 829-879 (handleReconnect)

---

### Client Side (static/quiz.html)

#### 1. Message Ordering System
```javascript
// Drops stale messages, buffers out-of-order ones
processMessage(msg) {
    if (msg.seq <= this.lastSeq) return null; // Drop stale
    if (msg.seq === this.lastSeq + 1) {
        this.lastSeq = msg.seq;
        return msg; // Process in order
    }
    this.pendingMessages.push(msg); // Buffer for later
    return null;
}
```

**Location**: Lines 1426-1461

#### 2. Application-Level Heartbeat
```javascript
// Pings server every 20s, auto-closes if no pong for 30s
setInterval(() => {
    ws.send({ type: 'ping' });
    if (Date.now() - lastPongTime > 30000) {
        ws.close(); // Trigger reconnection
    }
}, 20000);
```

**Location**: Lines 1500-1516

#### 3. Exponential Backoff Reconnection
```javascript
// Delays: 1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s ‚Üí 16s (max 5 attempts)
attemptReconnect() {
    const delay = 1000 * Math.pow(2, reconnectAttempts - 1);
    setTimeout(() => location.reload(), delay);
}
```

**Location**: Lines 1526-1541

#### 4. Full State Restoration on Reconnect
```javascript
case 'reconnected':
    // Sync sequence to prevent stale replay
    MultiplayerState.lastSeq = payload.current_seq;

    // Restore all player scores
    QuizState.score = payload.player_scores[myPlayerId];

    // Restore who has answered
    MultiplayerState.currentPlayerAnswered =
        payload.players_answered[myPlayerId];
```

**Location**: Lines 2405-2469

## üìä How to Verify the Fixes

### In Browser Console (quiz.html)

**Good Signs:**
```
[Quiz] Processing message in order: seq=42, type=next_question
[Quiz] ‚ù§Ô∏è Pong received
[Quiz] Synced message sequence to: 42
```

**Warnings (expected on slow networks):**
```
[Quiz] Buffering out-of-order message: seq=44, expected=43
[Quiz] Processing buffered message: seq=43, type=answer_submitted
```

**Bad Signs:**
```
[Quiz] Dropping stale/duplicate message: seq=40, lastSeq=42
[Quiz] No pong received for 30s, connection may be dead
```

---

### In Server Logs (terminal)

**Good Signs:**
```
üì§ Broadcasting 'next_question' to room ABC (2 recipients) [seq=42]
üìç Sending current question sync: Q5/10 (time remaining: 15s)
‚úÖ Player xyz reconnected to game abc
```

**Warnings:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Send buffer full for player xyz, dropping message type: score_update [seq=43]
```

## üß™ Testing the Fixes

### Quick Manual Test
1. Start server: `./ubible_server` or `go run main.go`
2. Open 2 browser windows
3. Create/join multiplayer game
4. **Test reconnection:**
   - Disable network on one client (DevTools ‚Üí Offline)
   - Wait 5 seconds
   - Re-enable network
   - Verify scores/question restore correctly

5. **Test ordering:**
   - Throttle network to "Slow 3G" (DevTools ‚Üí Network)
   - Play game normally
   - Check console for "Buffering out-of-order message" logs
   - Verify game still advances correctly

6. **Test heartbeat:**
   - Play game for 60+ seconds
   - Check console for "‚ù§Ô∏è Pong received" every ~20s

### Automated Test Suite
```bash
node test_websocket_improvements.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ PASS: Message sequence numbers present
‚úÖ PASS: No duplicate sequence numbers
‚úÖ PASS: Sequence numbers are monotonically increasing
‚úÖ PASS: Reconnection state snapshot has all required fields
‚úÖ PASS: Server responds to ping with pong
...
Success Rate: 100%
```

## üêõ Debugging Guide

### Problem: Quiz still freezes

**Check 1: Are sequence numbers present?**
- Browser console should show `seq=X` in logs
- If not: Server build may be old, rebuild with `go build`

**Check 2: Are messages being dropped?**
- Search server logs for "Send buffer full"
- If frequent: Slow client or too many players

**Check 3: Is client buffering messages?**
- Search browser console for "Buffering out-of-order"
- If stuck buffering: Gap in sequence, check network

**Check 4: Did reconnection restore state?**
- After reconnect, check console for "Restored score from server"
- If missing: Server may not have player in room

---

### Problem: Connection keeps dropping

**Check 1: Are pongs being received?**
- Search console for "‚ù§Ô∏è Pong received"
- Should appear every 20s
- If missing: Server ping handler broken

**Check 2: What's the reconnection delay?**
- Console shows "Reconnecting in Xms (attempt Y/5)"
- Delays: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
- If maxed out: Network or server issue

**Check 3: Check WebSocket close code**
- Console shows "WebSocket closed: CODE, REASON"
- 1000 = normal (game end)
- 1006 = abnormal (network issue)

---

## üìà Performance Impact

### Server
- **Memory**: +~1KB per room (50 message history)
- **CPU**: Negligible (atomic counter increment)
- **Network**: +16 bytes per message (seq + timestamp)

### Client
- **Memory**: +~500 bytes (pending buffer, heartbeat timer)
- **CPU**: Negligible (message ordering checks)
- **Network**: +1 ping/pong every 20s

## ‚úÖ Checklist Before Deployment

- [ ] Server builds without errors: `go build main.go`
- [ ] Browser console shows `seq=` in message logs
- [ ] Automated tests pass: `node test_websocket_improvements.js`
- [ ] Manual reconnection test works (disable/enable network)
- [ ] Heartbeat logs appear every ~20s
- [ ] No quiz freezes in 5-game stress test
- [ ] Server logs show `[seq=X]` in broadcasts

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Revert server:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   go build main.go
   ./ubible_server
   ```

2. **Revert client:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD~1 static/quiz.html
   ```

3. **Or use feature flag (future):**
   - Add `ENABLE_MESSAGE_ORDERING=false` env var
   - Wrap sequencing logic in `if (process.env.ENABLE_MESSAGE_ORDERING)`
