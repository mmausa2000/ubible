---

## How to Use

### Basic Usage

1. **Open Debugger**: Navigate to `/debugger` in your browser
2. **Connect**: Click "🔌 Connect"
3. **Perform Actions**: Create rooms, join games, etc.
4. **View Diagnostics**: Click "📊 Diagnostics" at any time

### Diagnostic Report

The report shows:
- ✅ Green checkmarks = No issues
- ⚠️ Yellow warnings = Minor issues detected
- 🔴 Red alerts = Critical issues

### Interpreting Results

**Message Ordering**
- Out-of-Order > 0: Network reordering packets
- Duplicates > 0: Network retransmitting or server bug
- Message Rate: Should match expected activity

**Race Conditions**
- Concurrent Updates > 0: Multiple state changes in <100ms
- May indicate race condition in client code

**Connection Health**
- Failure Rate > 5%: Connection unstable
- Check network or server load

**Heartbeat**
- Missed Pongs > 0: Server not responding
- Avg Latency > 200ms: Slow connection
- 3+ missed pongs: Connection dead

**Parsing**
- Errors > 0: Malformed JSON from server
- Check malformed message log for details

---

## Issue Detection Examples

### Example 1: Out-of-Order Messages
```
📨 RAW: {"type":"next_question","seq":44,...}
🔴 OUT-OF-ORDER: seq=44 (expected > 45), type=next_question
```

**Cause**: Network packet reordering
**Impact**: Client may process stale question
**Solution**: Client-side sequencing (already implemented in quiz.html)

### Example 2: Race Condition
```
🔴 RACE CONDITION: 5 state changes in 100ms
```

**Cause**: Multiple WebSocket messages updating same state
**Impact**: Unpredictable UI behavior
**Solution**: Queue state updates, process sequentially

### Example 3: Send Failure
```
🔴 SEND FAILED: WebSocket not OPEN (current: CLOSING)
```

**Cause**: Sending while connection closing
**Impact**: Message lost
**Solution**: Check readyState before sends (already implemented)

### Example 4: Missed Pong
```
🔴 MISSED PONG: No response for ping sent at 14:35:20
🔴 CRITICAL: 3+ missed pongs - connection may be dead
```

**Cause**: Server crashed or network down
**Impact**: Dead connection undetected
**Solution**: Auto-reconnect triggered

### Example 5: Parse Error
```
🔴 PARSE ERROR: Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0
Raw data: <html><body>404 Not Found...
```

**Cause**: HTTP response on WebSocket connection
**Impact**: Message processing fails
**Solution**: Check server routing

- ✅ #6 Broadcast Logic Errors - message sequence tracking
- ✅ #7 Reconnection Failures - reconnection stats
- ❌ #8 Server-Side Blocking - server-side metric

## Performance Impact

**Memory**
- ~50KB for diagnostics object
- Bounded buffers prevent unbounded growth
- Reset stats to free memory

**CPU**
- Negligible overhead (<1ms per message)
- Most operations are simple counters

**Network**
- No additional overhead
- Pings already sent every 5s
